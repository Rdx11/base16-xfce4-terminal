Base16 for XFCE4 Terminal
=========================

## Installation example

Run `mousepad ~/.config/xfce4/terminal/terminalrc` in the terminal

Copy lines from `base16-eighties.dark.terminalrc` file to your terminalrc file.
*If the terminalrc file is not empty, do not copy the `[Configuration]` line, as there should be only one in the beginning of the file.*

Close and open your terminal again to see changes
